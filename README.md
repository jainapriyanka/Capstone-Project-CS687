Input:
Users provide login credentials, transaction details (amount, category, type, date), and budget goals through a responsive web interface. This financial data becomes the foundation for personalized analysis. Data entry is intuitive, secure, and designed for both desktop and mobile experiences.

Process:
The MERN stack application authenticates users with JWT, stores and encrypts transactions in MongoDB, and sends data to a Python-based AI module. The AI processes spending patterns, predicts future expenses, and creates tailored budgeting tips. React.js dynamically updates the interface, while Material UI ensures a modern, responsive design for smooth navigation.

Output:
A dynamic dashboard featuring AI-driven budgeting recommendations, spending and income trends, expense forecasts, goal tracking, and interactive visualizations. The output empowers users to make smarter financial decisions and manage their money with confidence, offering real-time insights accessible anytime, anywhere on multiple devices.
